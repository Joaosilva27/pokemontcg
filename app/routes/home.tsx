              This particular card could only be found at the first ever Pok√©mon
              Trading Card Game tournament. In the Japanese competition, the top
              three competitors in each division were rewarded for their efforts
              with these cards. The Pikachu card represented the number three
              spot, essentially doubling as a bronze medal. The most valuable
              known card was graded an 8 and sold for $300,000.{" "}
